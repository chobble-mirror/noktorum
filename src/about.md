# About Chobble

Chobble is Stef and Alex from Prestwich, Manchester - web developers with over 30 years combined experience working on websites of all sizes - from small local charities and social groups to massive international storefronts.

We started Chobble to:

- Build websites and tools for local organisations and individuals
- Provide honest advice and guidance
- Contribute to the wider open source community

We charge a [flat per-hour rate](/prices/) and give full details of what's included.

We prefer solutions which empower their users and so prioritise open source and flexibility over proprietary or locked-in solutions.

We do not force you to host with us and provide instructions for hosting elsewhere or moving away - although you might like to host with us anyway.

We are happy to explain as much about how your website works as you like, and will share all of its source code by default.

We know many other tech-adjacent people (eg designers, copywriters, marketers) and are happy to connect you to them if you need their services.

If this sounds good, please [contact us](/contact/) to discuss your project!
