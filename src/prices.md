# Our Prices

We believe in transparent pricing. Our flat rate is **£200 per hour** (charged in half-hour increments), and initial consultations are free.

Our rate is **discounted 50%** at **£100 per hour** for:

- Charities and co-operatives
- Musicians, artists, and writers
- Vegan businesses
- Renewable energy businesses

We sometimes work for free, at our discretion.

## Service Charges (Static Sites)

You can host as many static websites as you like with us for **£40** per month, or **£20 if discounted**. For this fee we will:

- Host your sites
- Back up your sites
- Provide a content management system
- Host your DNS records
- Make any small changes you request
- Provide technical and marketing advice

You may choose to host elsewhere since you will have the full source code - that's totally fine. We recommend and support [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Neocities](https://neocities.org) and [Surge](https://surge.sh).

## Service Charges (Dynamic Sites)

We will host your Ruby on Rails dynamic site on its own server running NixOS. We will use the most affordable Gandi VPS server possible, starting at around £5 per month.

We will charge **£60** per month (or **£30 if discounted**) on top of whatever that hosting cost is. You will have full access to the server and its configuration. For this price we will:

- Host your service
- Back up your code
- Back up your database every day
- Provide your DNS records
- Make any small changes you request
- Provide technical advice

You can also host the site yourself, as you will have the full source code.

## Emails and Domain Renewals

We will help you source the ideal provider for your needs and budget. You will register and pay them directly, unless you *really* don't want to, in which case we can sort something out.

## Other Open Source Software

If you want to host Nextcloud for shared documents for your team, or a Mastodon server for your club, or anything else - we will help. And if you want to manage the server yourself and use us as local consultants, that's totally fine.
