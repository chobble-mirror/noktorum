# Frequently Asked Questions

*How do I book an appointment?* Simply fill out the form on my contact page or message me directly on Instagram. I will ask for a small nonrefundable deposit and we will set an appointment date together. 

*How much do you charge for a tattoo?* My prices vary and are generally tailored to each individual design. Please get in contact with your ideas for a quote.

*How old do I have to be to get a tattoo?* I will not tattoo anyone under the age of 18 years. 

*Sprechen Sie Deutsche?* Ein Bissen, aber nicht sehr gut. Ich bin in Schule und mochte mehr lernen. Bitte haben sie geduld mit mir! 

*Do you do cover-ups / tattoo over scars?* Yes. However this all depends on the detail of the cover-up and severity of the scarring. Feel free to get in contact and we can take a look. 

*Can I bring a friend?* Tattooing is not a spectator sport. I ask that you come alone to your appointment (you’re welcome to have a companion drop you off / make sure you’re ok. I just ask that they leave once the session starts.)

*Can I use numbing cream?* I’m ok with you using it, but can’t take any responsibility for its effects. Please do your own research and apply the cream yourself.

*Does it hurt?* I hope so.


Please note - I only create tattoos for nice human beings. I don’t like racism, I don’t like sexism. I don’t like homophobia. I will not tattoo any members of the far-right. This isn’t up for discussion.
